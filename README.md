# Welcome to the wiki for Figueroa Lab @ Penn!

This is a wiki page for softwares, hardwares, instructions, suggestions and many other resources in the lab. It is designed to help researchers in the lab ramp up efficiently and provide guidance for better utilization of lab resources. We hope to continuously and frequently update this wiki to keep the information up-to-date. It would be helpful if you could create new wikis for new resources or update the corresponding parts of the wiki after noticing any changes.
